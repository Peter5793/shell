.I COMMAND
.I [ARGUMENT]

.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.Bhsh
Creates a simple C shell that runs in interactive and non-interactive mode, similar to the basic "sh" shell. For more details, please refer to the README.md on the Github repository at https://github.com/sriniqtude/simple_shell. The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands. This program can be run on top of another shell.
.SH INVOCATION
If no args are present and if the standard input of the shell is connected to a terminal, the shell is considered an interactive shell. An interactive shell generally prompts before each command and handles programming and command errors differently.
.PP
Shell commands can be entered in the "hsh$" shell prompt.
.SH PATH SEARCH
When locating a command, the shell first looks to see if it has a shell function by that name. Then it looks for a builtin command by that name. If a builtin command is not found, one of two things happen:
.PP
     1.   Command names containing a slash are simply executed without performing any searches.
.PP
     2.   The shell searches each entry in PATH in turn for the command. The value of the PATH variable should be a series of entries separated by colons. Each entry consists of a directory name. The current directory may be indicated implicitly by an empty directory name, or explicitly by a single period.
.PP
--handles command line with arguments
.PP
exit - implements the exit built-in that exits the shell
.PP
env - implements the env built-in that prints the current environment
.SH OTHER
.PP
Built-ins and aliases are not supported at this time.
